Intelligent Registration System

The Intelligent Registration System is a web-based application developed to efficiently collect, validate, and manage user registration details through a structured and user-friendly interface. The primary objective of this project is to ensure accurate data entry, improve user experience, and prevent invalid or incomplete submissions using client-side validation techniques. The system demonstrates how a well-designed registration workflow can improve reliability, usability, and data quality in modern web applications.

The application is divided into logical sections that guide the user step by step through the registration process. The Personal Information section captures essential user details such as first name, last name, email address, phone number, and gender. These fields are validated to ensure correctness and completeness before submission. The Location section allows users to select their country, state, and city, making the form more interactive and structured. The Security section focuses on password creation and confirmation, ensuring that users provide matching and valid credentials, which enhances the overall security of the system.
